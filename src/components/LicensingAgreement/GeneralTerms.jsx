              Smartists Licenses are International Smart Licensing Agreements
              [I.S.L.A.] designed to enable Intellectual Property holders
              -writers, artists, musicians, performers and digital editors- to
              grant copyrights of their content in their terms. Thanks to these
              I.S.L.A. art works, identified as Genuine NFTs, become available
              for purchase in the Stacks ecosystem so that ‘Creative-Users’ who
              buy the Genuine NFTs can use the underlying art digital files
              according to the copyrights granted by the licensor, and for a
              price paid directly to the Genuine NFT creator.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">
              When a Genuine NFT is minted and NO license is attached at the
              time of the sale, the creator reserves all copyrights and the
              buyer can only use the NFT for private and non-commercial
              purposes.

              more regulations to come, and also better solutions may arise in
              the future, which can trigger updates to these terms, that will be
